\subsection{The stable fixtures problem with payments}
\paragraph{Authors} 
Biro, Kern, Paulusma, and Wojuteczky (2016) \cite{Biro2017}
\paragraph{Results}
They study stable fixtures and multiple partner matching games, and the connections between them. We will focus on their multiple partner matching game results here.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $b \leq 2$ then we can separate allocations from the core of a multiple partner matching game in polynomial time.
\item The problem of deciding whether a multiple partners assignment game with $b=3$ and $w=1$ is co-NP complete, via a reduction from the NP-complete problem CUBIC SUBGRAPH.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Testing core non-emptiness for multiple partners assignment game with $b=3$.
\item Finding a core allocation with $b=3$.
\item Shapley value of multiple partner matching games restricted to trees or other simple structures.
\end{itemize}
There are many others mentioned in the paper related to the stable fixtures connection not yet explored in this writeup.

\subsection{On the Nucleolus of Shortest Path Games}
\paragraph{Authors}
Baiou, Barahona (2017) \cite{baiou2017nucleolus}
\paragraph{Results}
A polynomial time combinatorial algorithm for nucleolus computation (both core empty and non-empty) in shortest path games on directed graphs.
